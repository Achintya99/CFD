Simulated heat transfer on flat plate<br>
Console Application1 is Implicit method.
<br>
In this project heat transfer was simulated and the results were compared using the 3 methods.<br>
The explicit method had a time step restriction as expected. A grid independent study was also done and a mesh size of 75X75 was found to be optimal.
